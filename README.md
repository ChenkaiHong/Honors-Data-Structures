# Honors-Data-Structures
Data Structures is a one-semester course that introduces elementary data structures and algorithms to students who are fluent in at least one programming language. It is taken by students who have completed AP Computer Science A (not AP CS A with Data Structures) and is typical of the second course in computer science at most universities. Using a combination of programming assignments, worksheets and class discussions, students learn to use, create and analyze linked lists, smart arrays, stacks, queues, sets, maps, binary trees, binary search trees and heaps. Students study algorithms such as traversals, insertion, deletion of information across all these data structures, and learn how to characterize their performance in terms of both space and time. Programming projects utilize the algorithms and data structures discussed to create a variety of programs including games such as Solitaire.
